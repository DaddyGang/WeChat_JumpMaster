WeChat Jumping Chess game was popular in early 2018. People compete against each other trying to hit the highest record score among friends. Well, where there is competition, there is ~~cheating~~. While many automation methods on the Internet uses PDB tools or screenshots as an interface, these methods are easily busted by anti-cheating algorithms maintained by a bunch of smart people at WeChat team.

With my approach, using real camera as the sensor and steering motor as the executer, every time the arm hits the screen, the position is going to be slightly different. This means that there could be no means of distinguishing between a robot arm and a human player.

With just several attempts, I managed to hit socres as high as *1437*.
